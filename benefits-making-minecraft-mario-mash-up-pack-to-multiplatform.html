    <title> benefits making Super Mario Mash-up Pack (from Minecraft: Bedrock Edition) to multiple platforms </title>
  </head>

<body>
  As you probably know, i am still fighting for the Super Mario Mash-up Pack to made available to other platforms of Minecraft since late 2023.
  <br>
  here's benefits if the Super Mario Mash-up Pack was made to multiple platforms and usable on cross-platform multiplayer:
  <br><br>
  No more annoying platform-restriction pop-up <br>
  The one you see when you equipped the skin from the mash-up pack and enter a singleplayer world even with multiplayer disabled, this move is immoral even if it's not an design, this is why sometimes i called it "Unlawful Restriction" in Mojang Bug Tracker.
  <br><br>
  It can be used anywhere<br>
  you could equip the skin, activate the resource pack and play the world from Super Mario Mash-up Pack without fear of not having friends of other platforms not joining, in fact you could do these three on other platforms (as obviously stated)
  <br><br>
  No need for downloading from the internet <br>
  Piracy (if paid) / sideloading (if free) of the mash-up pack becomes less justified because you no longer need these to port the Super Mario Mash-up Pack to platforms you like! (as long as if this was sole justification)
  <br><br>
  No workaround was required <br>
  You won't need to perform a workaround everytime you attempt to join the friend's world with your favorite Mario skins greater than defaults on, as you obviously could just have simply joined-in
  <br><br>
  Accessing it would be easy as other contents <br>
  Players who owned the mash-up pack can create the world on platforms they like, making access way easier.
  <br><br><br>


  Currently, there's disbenefits with the current restrictions set-up (legitmate and malicous compliance only):
  <br><br>
  all players are required to have Nintendo Switch to play the world template from Super Mario Mash-up Pack, which is monopolastic, additionally the world template loads poorly compared to creating the new world from scratch on Nintendo Switch, making it ironic.
  <br><br>
  players are required to switch away from skins if they need to play with cross-platform multiplayer enabled or on cross-platform multiplayer
  <br><br>
  Although the Super Mario Mash-up Pack is included on Nintendo Switch, it was not available on platforms besides Nintendo consoles. As of that, it can't be updated as early as the rest of 4J Studio's mash-up packs
  <br><br>
  As obvious, you'll be annoyed with and / or blocked by platform-restriction popups
  <br><br>
  Communities were needed to make sketches of the skins so they could port it to other platforms, which requires complexity / creativity to get it working (sketching it does not add platform restriction back which was epic)
  <br><br><br><br>

  As a result, i begged Minecraft Support (banned doing so), reported such to Mojang Bug Tracker (invalidated, and currently no justifications on doing so), <a href=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021759332--Licensed-Content-Super-Mario-mashup>upvoted and posted comments for it on Minecraft Feedback</a>, and even contacted Nintendo Customer Support (the one which has it's header licensing it) for this very issue. (not in order)
